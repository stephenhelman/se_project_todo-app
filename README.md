# Simple Todo App

The Simple To Do App is an easy way to keep track of things that you need "todo"

## Functionality

There is a default list of todos, but you can add as many todos as you want.
You can also add a due date in case you want to make sure things are done by a certain date.

When you are done with the todo, you can check the box and mark it as complete.
If you would prefer to remove the todo altogether, you can also delete the item with the delete button

## Technology

This project was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Inside of JavaScript I utilized Modular Javascript, implementing multiple files and separation of code logic.
I also utilized Classes for the todo items, as well as the form validation.

Each todo item is created as an instance of the Todo Class, and rendered using the public getView() method.
Each input field is validated using an instance of the FormValidator Class.

Validation is enabled using the enableValidation() method
When the todo form is submitted, the form is rest using the resetValidation() method

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
